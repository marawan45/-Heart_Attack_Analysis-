❤️ Heart Attack Risk Analysis - Data Science Project
📌 Overview
This project explores a dataset related to heart disease to identify key factors that influence the risk of heart attacks. Using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning classification models, it aims to support early detection and risk prediction of heart attacks.

🎯 Objectives
Understand the relationship between various clinical attributes and heart attack risk.

Perform data cleaning and transformation.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart attack risk.

Highlight key risk factors through feature importance analysis.

🧪 Dataset
The dataset includes medical and demographic attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Target (Presence or absence of heart disease)

Source: Commonly used heart disease dataset (e.g., UCI Heart Disease dataset)
